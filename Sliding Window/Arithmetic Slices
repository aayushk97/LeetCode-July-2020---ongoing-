//At every index i we find the number of elements in arithmetic series starting at this point. Since, we need to find all such sequences we add the size-1 to the
//final count as size-1 sequences are possible. Here, size is lenght of the sequence but in program size is size-1 as we are counting from 1 index from after
//current index.
