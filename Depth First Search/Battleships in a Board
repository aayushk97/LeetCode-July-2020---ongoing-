//We can either use flood fill algorithm i.e, for each cell 'X' we visit its horizontal or vertical cells if they are 'X' and mark them visited and increase count 
//by 1 for this continuous seq of 'X'.
//We can also do the below, where we count it as one if this row is 'X' and prev row was 'X' then we don't increment count same for column.
