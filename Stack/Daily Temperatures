//We store the temp and index of each day in a stack and to see if a greater one is present in future we just pop the stack untill we get such a temp.
//Otherwise by default it is 0. Then we push this element with its index int the stack so earlier elements can refer to it.
//Here since elements lesser to it have been popped. If an element greater than this is present previously then it would not have the popped elements as greater
//temp if the elemnent is lesser than this then that would have this as greater element.
